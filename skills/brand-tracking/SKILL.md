description: Follow the brands the user tracks in SellWinners, covering the daily digest of new ads, what changed for one brand, its scaling ads and video scripts, and managing tracked brands, boards and saved items. Use when the user asks what is new with the brands they track, wants a daily or weekly radar, or asks to track, save, organise or share brands, ads, shops or emails.

# Follow tracked brands

Use the tools of the SellWinners connector. Tool calls use the user's SellWinners credits (`usage_get` shows what is left).

These steps and answer formats are defaults. When the user explicitly asks for a different format, order, number of results or SellWinners tool, follow the user. The rules on confirmations, public links, the plan and the monthly quota always apply.

## Read what changed

- **Daily digest:** `daily_radar` lists who launched ads in the last day and the last week, most active first. Pass `folder_id` to keep one folder; `list_brandtracker_folders` lists them.
- **The tracked brands:** `list_tracked_brands`, with `sort_by` `newAdsLast7Days`, `newAdsLast30Days` or `activeAds`.
- **One brand over a period:** `analyze_brand_changes` with `brand` (or `brandtracker_id`), `period` `1d`, `7d`, `14d` or `30d`, and `focus` (`ads`, `hooks`, `landing_pages`, `messaging`, `testing` or `all`).
- **One brand in depth:** `analyze_tracked_brand` returns its profile, dashboard, hooks and audience.
- **Its scaling ads:** `get_brandtracker_scaling_ads` with `ad_rank_window` `7d`, `14d` or `30d`.
- **Its video scripts:** `get_brandtracker_transcripts` with a `time_period` such as `last7d`.
- **What the user saved:** `find_saved_items` with `query` searches every board and the favorites; `list_boards` and `list_favorites` list them.

Lead with what changed and why it matters: new launches, ads gaining rank, new hooks or offers. Then the detail, with links to the ads.

## Make changes only when asked

- **Track a brand:** `add_to_brandtracker` with exactly one of `domain`, `facebook_page_id`, `shop_id` or `website_id`, and `folder_id` if the user named a folder. `create_brandtracker_folder`, `rename_brandtracker_folder` and `move_tracked_brands` organise them.
- **Boards:** `list_boards`, `create_board` (a `collection` holds items, a `folder` holds boards), and `add_board_item` with `source_type` `meta_ad`, `google_ad`, `tiktok`, `shop`, `email`, `advertiser` or `product`.
- **Favorites:** `list_favorites` and `add_favorite_item` with `kind` `ads`, `shops` or `emails`.

Tools that delete, archive, remove or create a public share link need `confirm=true`. Before you pass it, tell the user exactly what will be removed or made public and wait for them to agree. A public link lets anyone who has it see the board, folder or ad.

When a tool says a request is outside the user's plan (`plan_not_eligible`), don't try to get the same data another way, with other brands or other SellWinners tools. Tell the user in one sentence what the message says, with the link it gives, and answer the rest of the question with what the plan covers.

A tool named here can be missing from the connector when the user's plan doesn't include it. Then say so in one sentence and answer with the tools that are there.

When a tool answers that the plan's credits are used up, or that the plan doesn't include MCP access, stop calling SellWinners tools for this request. Tell the user in one sentence, with the renew date, the wait or the link the message gives.
